# Biohackathon-Team-16
# Task B: Selecting a disease to study - Cystic Fibrosis
Symptoms, diagnostic, and prognostic criteria:
  diagnostic criteria: patients must meet the criteria in at least two categories
    - positive newborn screening
    - elevated sweat levels (>/= 60 mmol/L
    - abnormal nasal potiental difference measurements
    - consistent cystic fibrosis clinical symtpoms
    - identification of two disease causing mutations in cystic fibrosis.
Frontline treatments:

Criteria for a successful treatment:

Options if frontline therapy fails:

Organs involved in expression of cystic fibrosis:

# Task C: Finding a gene underlying cystic fibrosis
Genes associated with CF:

When are these genes normally expressed in development:

What tissue are these genes expressed in:

When are these genes abnormally expressed in CF and in what tissue:

# Task D: Build a protein:protein interaction (PPI) network using the known gene protein product(s) as seeds.

What is the difference between a protein:protein interaction (PPI) network and a gene co-expression network?

How do I find interacting proteins with a seed protein?  Use the EBI Intact database as an example.  Also note how one can access Intact via Cytoscape.

How can I visualize and analyze the PPI network?  For example, how can I determine if the network is scale-free? Use Cytoscape as an example tool.

How can I find pathway and disease enrichment for these genes?  Use Toppfun as an example. 

# Task E: Find tissue-specific eQTLs DNA polymorphisms that could alter the expression of the candidate genes. (

What is an eQTL?  Please explain in the context of the human organism.

How do I find eQTLs associated with genes using the GTEx project?  Please provide an example using breast tissue on eQTLs that control BRCA1 expression.

# Task F: Construct an hypothesis that the genes caused the disease phenotype by mechanism X.

Design an experiment to test the hypothesis that your PPI genetic subsytem network could lead to non wild-type gene expression.

# Task G. Write a report in a github repository and send it to Feltus.

How do I create a git repository at github?  How do I add a license and make it public?

What are the basics of github markdown language?

Provide a basic overview of the github markdown language.
